AUTH:
1. First time loading the app and it displayed this on the user page- https://prnt.sc/7edWr9uK4NeP which is wrong, no one got registered
2. There could be a 2FA/ session timeout implementation, reason is whenever i launch the app url,its takes me to the last user's todo list, which shouldn't be so
